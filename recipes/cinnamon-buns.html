  <li>½ cup milk</li>
  <li>¼ cup white sugar</li>
  <li>¼ cup unsalted butter</li>
  <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
  <li>2 large eggs, beaten</li>
  <li>4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
</ul>

<h3>Glaze:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>¾ cup unsalted butter</li>
  <li>¾ cup brown sugar</li>
  <li>½ cup chopped pecans</li>
</ul>

<h3>Filling:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>¼ cup unsalted butter, melted</li>
  <li>¾ cup brown sugar</li>
  <li>½ cup chopped pecans</li>
  <li>1 tablespoon ground cinnamon</li>
</ul>

<h2>Directions</h2>
<ol>
  <li>
    Make the dough: Pour water into a liquid measure. Add 1 teaspoon of sugar
    and active dry yeast; stir until dissolved. Let stand until foamy, about 10
    minutes.
  </li>

  <li>
    Meanwhile, warm milk in a small saucepan over medium heat until it just
    starts to bubble around the edges; do not boil. Remove from the heat and
    stir in 1/4 cup sugar, 1/4 cup unsalted butter, and salt until melted. Let
    cool until lukewarm.
  </li>

  <li>
    Lightly whisk eggs in a large bowl. Add yeast mixture, lukewarm milk
    mixture, and 1 1/2 cups flour; stir until well combined.
  </li>

  <li>
    Mix in remaining 2 1/2 cups flour (1/2 cup at a time), mixing well after
    each addition, until dough comes together.
  </li>

  <li>
    Place dough in an oiled bowl and turn to coat with oil. Cover with a damp
    cloth and let rise in a warm place until doubled in volume, about 1 hour.
  </li>

  <li>
    While the dough is rising, make the glaze: Melt 3/4 cup of unsalted butter
    in a small saucepan over medium heat. Add 3/4 cup brown sugar and whisk
    until smooth.
  </li>

  <li>
    Grease a 9x13-inch pan. Pour glaze mixture into the pan; sprinkle pecans
    over to
  </li>
  p.

  <li>
    Make the filling: Place 1/4 cup melted butter in a small bowl. Combine 3/4
    cup of brown sugar, pecans, and cinnamon in a separate bowl.
  </li>

  <li>
    When the dough has doubled in size, turn it out onto a lightly floured
    surface. Roll into a 14x18-inch rectangle. Brush 1/2 of the melted butter
    over the dough, leaving a 1/2-inch border unbuttered. Sprinkle brown sugar
    mixture over top.
  </li>

  <li>
    Start at the long edge and roll the dough tightly, pinching the seams to
    seal. Brush remaining butter over the dough. Cut dough into 15 equal rolls.
  </li>

  <li>
    Place rolls, cut-sides down, into the glaze in the prepared pan. Cover and
    let rise until double in size, about 1 hour.
  </li>

  <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>

  <li>
    Uncover and bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 25 to 30 minutes.
  </li>

  <li>
    Let cool in pan for 3 minutes, then invert onto a serving platter so the
    glaze is on top. Scrape any remaining glaze from the pan onto the rolls.
  </li>
